# Barangay-e-Services-Portal
A centralized and secure web-based platform that streamlines the processing of barangay-related documents such as clearances, IDs, and certifications. This system allows residents to request services online while enabling barangay staff to manage, approve, and release documents efficiently.

üìù System Description:
The Barangay e-Services Portal is designed to digitize and simplify the traditional manual process of handling barangay documents. Through an intuitive interface, residents can log in, request certificates, and track the status of their applications in real-time. Meanwhile, authorized barangay staff (admins) can access a secure backend panel to verify requests, approve applications, upload documents, and notify residents when their documents are ready. Optional features like QR code verification ensure document authenticity.
